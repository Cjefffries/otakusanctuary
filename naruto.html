                <p>Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story
                    of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the
                    Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts—the first set in Naruto's pre-teen
                    years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri
                    (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the
                    following year, and Naruto (1997).

                    Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, with
                    its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series
                    produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of
                    the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the
                    original series, premiered in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English dub was
                    broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to
                    Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. The
                    English dub is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Viz Media began streaming the anime
                    series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012 on 99 episodes, and ended in March
                    2016, after 338 episodes. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve
                    original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video
                    games, and trading cards developed by several companies.

                    Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their
                    digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada
                    in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most
                    OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters.
                    The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations:
                    Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his father's.

                    Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series in history having 250 million copies in circulation
                    worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97
                    million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English
                    translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list
                    several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's
                    character development, strong storylines, and well-executed action sequences, though some felt the
                    action sequences slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age
                    theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.</p>
